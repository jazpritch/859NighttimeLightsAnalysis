# 859NighttimeLightsAnalysis 

In September 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by two devestating hurricanes. Category 5 hurricane, Irma, passed close to the main island on September 7th, causing widespread outages. This event was followed by Hurricane Maria, which made landfall on September 20th. The impact of damage, knowcked out over 80% of Puerto Rico's electric grid leaving residents without power for months, and somes areas not having restoration until a year later. These events resulted in the longest blackout in U.S. history.

This project is an opportunity to start exploring how nighttime lights datasets, which monitor human activity patterns, can be used to understand the urban environment and the risks surrounding it. Monitoring disruptions to the electrical grid is needed for better disaster response and long-term recovery efforts. This workflow was developed by using the ArcGIS API for python, but can be used in various applications including through Google Earth Engine and python scripting with the Arcpy package. In the future I hope to explore how to extract nighttime light intensity from satellite imagery and further develop this project
